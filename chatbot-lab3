Enable API's:
Compute Engine API
Dialogflow API
Cloud Storage
Cloud Source Repositories API
Cloud Natural Language API

You'll use a NoSQL database called Cloud Datastore to store content extracted from the document.
To enable Cloud Datastore, enable the associated App Engine service.

Get started with Cloud Datalab:
Pre-Processing Notebooks;

ProcessHandbook.ipynb performs "semi-structured" analysis on the HR Manual text file. It alternately extracts topic "headings" and associated "policy text" from the file and stores these as key-value pairs in Cloud Datastore to give the chatbot a basic vocabulary.

ProcessSynonyms.ipynb uses several Python data science libraries and the Cloud Natural Language API to generate synonyms for topics, which gives the chatbot an expanded vocabulary.

DialogFlow.ipynb uses Dialogflow's "Entity" API to write the topics to Dialogflow's Entity module, which makes these words available to the chatbot as a data type.
